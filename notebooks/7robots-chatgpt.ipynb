The Moon is like a quarter of the size of Earth, which makes it the largest natural satellite in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet.

It's totally covered in these craters from all these meteor impacts, and the biggest of these is the South Pole-Aitken basin. But the coolest part is that these craters have given it that unique moonlit glow that we see at night. Like, how lit is that?!\n","\n","Of course, we've left footprints up there. We humans just can't help but leave our mark, right? The first man on the moon, Neil Armstrong, did it in 1969, which is like, over 50 years ago... woah!\n","\n","The Moon doesn't have an atmosphere, by the by. Gives me the shivers, no air to breathe, right?! That’s why it can't retain any water on its surface. No surfing opportunities for us, dudes and dudettes.\n","\n","Lastly, Scientists believe the Moon was formed when a Mars-sized body collided with Earth.

These folks called astronauts from a mission like Apollo 11 or whatevs, went there in 1969.

Or its bad side, like all those insta-models. \n","\n","But in the end, you've gotta admit, having the Moon out there makes the night sky look all poetic and junk.

The skunk went running around the house trailing a path of fire behind him, which made him look more like a rocket flying around. \n","\n","On the other hand, Chatter, so excited to jump out and surprise Prickle, accidentally bumped against an acorn pile, sending them everywhere. They ricocheted across the room, startling every guest who had just witnessed a rocket skunk.\n","\n","Amidst the chaos, Prickle the porcupine entered his house carrying berries and was overwhelmed to see all the commotion. Bewildered, he accidentally released his quills, causing everyone to duck for cover. \n","\n","On seeing the situation, Sniffer, though still flaming, found a bucket of water to put out his fiery tail. His sudden skunk spray, due to the cold water on his singed tail, added just the perfect finishing touch to the welcome party, sending all guests running for fresh air.\n","\n","As the forest quieted down, Sniffer, Chatter, and a now, very surprised Prickle, stood amidst the chaos. The silence was broken by an uncontrollable fit of laughter from the trio. They decided that the party was a complete disaster, yet the most fun-filled disaster anyone could have ever expected. \n","\n","From that day on, Prickle, Sniffer, and Chatter became the best of friends, often reminiscing about their unexpected, hilarious welcome party.
